# Introduction {#intro}

## Context
This report outlines the results from a three year intercollegiate research project funded by the**PAREA** agency ( _Programmme d'Aide à la Recherche en Enseignment et Apprentissage_) from the _Ministère de l'Education_ of the provincial Government of Quebec.

In the province of Quebec, students finish their secondary education at what is the equivalent of Grade 11 in other parts of North America. Students are then able to attend **CEGEP** ( _Collège d'enseignment général et professionel_) for either 

 - two years, as part of pre-university program, e.g Science, Social Science, Liberal Arts
 - three years, as part of technical program, meant specifically to lead directly to the job market, e.g. Nursing, Civil Engineering Technology, Diagnotsic Imaging Technology
 
There are 48 CEGEPs in the Quebec network, and public or private, they all fall under the purview of the _Ministère de l'Education et Enseignment Superieur_. Over the past twenty years, there has been significant work[@jorgensen2003students; @jorgensen2005academic; @jorgensen2009predicting; @riviere1995decrocheurs; @shaienks2008statcan] and media [@breton2016soleil; @dion-viens2015lapresse; @duchaine2017lapresse] on the topic of student attrition in CEGEP. The scholarly work done has often focused on determing predictors of attrition through surveys, or focused on specific vulnerable sub populations. The media has often reported on government figures, which rely on data that looks at information at a very coarse level of granularity (of students graduated from high schoolhow many obtain diplomas from CEGEP)

## Objectives

Almost all of the CEGEP's use the same database system, known as **CLARA** (developped by the company Skytech) in order to manage the data related to student admission, registration and graduation. Our research team's main objective is to leverage this uniformity of how data is automatically generated and stored, in order to determine if, in this wealth of data, there might be predictors of student attrition. This effort stands apart from previous work and reports in that:

 - the data analyzed is much finer-grained: the unit of analysis is down to the semester registration records for each student
 - we look at the general population of students
 - to our knowledge, this is the first ever such study to span multiple CEGEPs, which we hope adds a greater relibility and validity to our findings.
 
This project has two specific objectives:

 1) find predictors of students dropping out, whether they be demographic, or based in academic performance, on a term by term basis. 
 2) evaluate methods by which students can be automatically flagged as being at risk of dropping out, without so much a focus on understanding why, but for the purpose of "general offers of support" or further investigation

This report is structured to reflect these two objectives. Namely, we begin with
 - a standard review of previous [related work](#littreview),
 - a section on [descriptive statistics](#descriptive) which gives an overview of the dataset.
 
We then move on to our methods and models over two chapters: 
 - the [first](#explanatory) addresses objective 1, outlining our efforts to find explanatory predictors of student attrition in classical statistical models. 
 - The [following chapter](#predictive) addresses objective 2, describing modern methods from the field of machine learning, which, at the expense of model interpretability, are fit to provide maximum predictive accuracy in identifying students at-risk. 
 
The report then concludes with
 - [comparisons](#comparisons) of these methods with each other, and to current intervention frameworks in place at participating colleges
 - an auxilliary chapter looking at students from the division of [Continuing Education](#conted) 
 - a [concluding chapter](#conclusion), with reccomendations for future directions

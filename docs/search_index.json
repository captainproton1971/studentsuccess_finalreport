What fraction of students are counted year after year as drop-outs and labeled as problems to be solved by the system while being exemplary students in terms of academic performance. Armed with this dataset, we can get the answer to that question. Let us begin by looking at the average grades of students who eventually dropped out compared to grades of students who haven’t. The following set of graphs will look at that comparison for 3 different semesters: the semester in which they dropped out (or graduated), the semester before that and the one before that. Let us see what the data says. ## ## Welch Two Sample t-test ## ## data: students_last_session$Average[which(students_last_session$status == and students_last_session$Average[which(students_last_session$status == &quot;grad&quot;)] and &quot;out&quot;)] ## t = 78.251, df = 7349.6, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 20.36923 21.41600 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x mean of y ## 79.97370 59.08109 We can see that…. Let us now look at a semester by semester basis. Let us start by looking at the average grades of students on the semester during which they are either graduating or dropping-out. ## ## Welch Two Sample t-test ## ## data: c2[, .SD[.N], by = c(&quot;student_number&quot;)][status == &quot;out&quot;]$V1 and c2[, .SD[.N], by = c(&quot;student_number&quot;)][status == &quot;grad&quot;]$V1 ## t = -84.565, df = 7363.6, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -28.74741 -27.44482 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x mean of y ## 51.08037 79.17648 We can see that the data says that… Let us now turn our attention to the semester before the one where they graduate or drop out. As we go back in time, we are expecting the difference between the two groups to diminish. ## ## Welch Two Sample t-test ## ## data: c2[, .SD[.N - 1], by = c(&quot;student_number&quot;)][status == &quot;out&quot;]$V1 and c2[, .SD[.N - 1], by = c(&quot;student_number&quot;)][status == &quot;grad&quot;]$V1 ## t = -57.484, df = 6274.5, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -17.01062 -15.88867 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x mean of y ## 64.24363 80.69328 Finally, let us look at 2 semesters before they graduate or drop-out. We are again expecting the same trend. ## ## Welch Two Sample t-test ## ## data: c2[, .SD[.N - 2], by = c(&quot;student_number&quot;)][status == &quot;out&quot;]$V1 and c2[, .SD[.N - 2], by = c(&quot;student_number&quot;)][status == &quot;grad&quot;]$V1 ## t = -41.354, df = 4162.2, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -12.11730 -11.02037 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x mean of y ## 68.90087 80.46971 Sweet. Now let’s look at… 4.2 Fraction of students who change colleges "]

What fraction of students are counted year after year as drop-outs and labeled as problems to be solved by the system while being exemplary students in terms of academic performance. Armed with this dataset, we can get the answer to that question. Let us begin by looking at the average grades of students who eventually dropped out compared to grades of students who haven’t. The following set of graphs will look at that comparison for 3 different semesters: the semester in which they dropped out (or graduated), the semester before that and the one before that. Let us see what the data says. ## ## Welch Two Sample t-test ## ## data: students_last_session$Average[which(students_last_session$status == and students_last_session$Average[which(students_last_session$status == &quot;grad&quot;)] and &quot;out&quot;)] ## t = 78.251, df = 7349.6, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 20.36923 21.41600 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x mean of y ## 79.97370 59.08109 From the average total grade between the drop outs and the graduates, we can clearly see that the distributions are significantly different, but what is surprising is that 22% of students have an average grade above 75% and that more than 52% of the students who dropped out had an average grade above 60%. In other words, most students who drop out have passing averages. One hypothesis for this effect is that students who end up dropping out start with good semesters and have their performance decline closer to the final semester. Let us verify this hypothesis. Let us now look at the performance of drop outs vs graduates on a semester by semester basis. Let us start by looking at the average grades of students in their last semester during which they are either graduating or dropping-out. ## ## Welch Two Sample t-test ## ## data: c2[, .SD[.N], by = c(&quot;student_number&quot;)][status == &quot;out&quot;]$V1 and c2[, .SD[.N], by = c(&quot;student_number&quot;)][status == &quot;grad&quot;]$V1 ## t = -84.565, df = 7363.6, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -28.74741 -27.44482 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x mean of y ## 51.08037 79.17648 In this data, we can clearly observe a stark difference between the graduates and the drop outs. First of all, note that 22% of students still have a term average over 75% in the semester in which they drop out. To push it further 14% of students who drop out have an average grade over 80%. The data clearly suggests that some of the drop outs aren’t dropping out because of academic performance. Furthermore, the long tail of the data on the low end of performance suggests that some of the students stopped coming to class prior to the end of the semester resulting in very low grades that serve to drive their cegep average grades from the graph above even lower. 35% of students have a grade below 40 suggesting that they have indeed stopped coming to school some time during the semester. What if these students hadn’t stopped coming, would their performance be similar to that of graduates? Let us now turn our attention to the semester before the one where they graduate or drop out. ## ## Welch Two Sample t-test ## ## data: c2[, .SD[.N - 1], by = c(&quot;student_number&quot;)][status == &quot;out&quot;]$V1 and c2[, .SD[.N - 1], by = c(&quot;student_number&quot;)][status == &quot;grad&quot;]$V1 ## t = -57.484, df = 6274.5, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -17.01062 -15.88867 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x mean of y ## 64.24363 80.69328 The data clearly shows that even if there are significant differences between the groups Finally, let us look at 2 semesters before they graduate or drop-out. We are again expecting the same trend. ## ## Welch Two Sample t-test ## ## data: c2[, .SD[.N - 2], by = c(&quot;student_number&quot;)][status == &quot;out&quot;]$V1 and c2[, .SD[.N - 2], by = c(&quot;student_number&quot;)][status == &quot;grad&quot;]$V1 ## t = -41.354, df = 4162.2, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -12.11730 -11.02037 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x mean of y ## 68.90087 80.46971 Sweet. Now let’s look at… 4.2 Fraction of students who change colleges "]

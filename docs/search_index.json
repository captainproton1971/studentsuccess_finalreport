["comparisons.html", "Chapter 7 Comparisons", " Chapter 7 Comparisons This chapter will compare the effectiveness of the methods developped in the previous two chapters, and compare them to more basic approaches to identifying students at-risk. For example, we know that some CEGEPs have implemented a policy whereby they identify students as being at risk based on their mid-term assessments: if the student receives a certain number of “at-risk” or “failing” results, they are automatically sent an email referring them to academic support services. Based on this, we can ask the following research questions : - how effective is this approach at identifying students who drop-out? - how does this approach compare to our models from the previous chapters? We begin with a basic logistic regression with demographic variables, and as well as the number of each type of results of mid-term assessment, for students in their last term at the college. With these predictors, we try to predict if students are about to graduate, or simply not register again. Estimate Std.

\chapter{Preface}\label{preface}

This report summarizes the work done by our team on using college
registration records at three diffrenet anglophone CEGEPS in Montreal in
order to find predictors of attrition.

\chapter{Introduction}\label{intro}

This report outlines the results from a three year intercollegiate
research project funded by the\textbf{PAREA} agency ( \emph{Programmme
d'Aide à la Recherche en Enseignment et Apprentissage}) from the
\emph{Ministère de l'Education} of the provincial Government of Quebec.

In the province of Quebec, students finish their secondary education at
what is the equivalent of Grade 11 in other parts of North America.
Students are then able to attend \textbf{CEGEP} ( \emph{Collège
d'enseignment général et professionel}) for either

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  two years, as part of pre-university program, e.g Science, Social
  Science, Liberal Arts
\item
  three years, as part of technical program, meant specifically to lead
  directly to the job market, e.g.~Nursing, Civil Engineering
  Technology, Diagnotsic Imaging Technology
\end{itemize}

There are 48 CEGEPs in the Quebec network, and public or private, they
all fall under the purview of the \emph{Ministère de l'Education et
Enseignment Superieur}. Over the past twenty years, there has been
significant
work\citep{jorgensen2003students, jorgensen2005academic, jorgensen2009predicting, riviere1995decrocheurs, shaienks2008statcan}
and media
\citep{breton2016soleil, dion-viens2015lapresse, duchaine2017lapresse}
on the topic of student attrition in CEGEP. The scholarly work done has
often focused on determing predictors of attrition through surveys, or
focused on specific vulnerable sub populations. The media has often
reported on government figures, which rely on data that looks at
information at a very coarse level of granularity (of students graduated
from high schoolhow many obtain diplomas from CEGEP)

Almost all of the CEGEP's use the same database system, known as
\textbf{CLARA} in order to manage the data related to student admission,
registration and graduation. Our research team's main objective is to
leverage this uniformity of how data is automatically generated and
stored, in order to determine if, in this wealth of data, there might be
predictors of student attrition. This effort stands apart from previous
work and reports in that - the data analyzed is much finer-grained: the
unit of analysis is down to the semester registration records for each
student - we look at the general population of students - with every
additional college that participates in our study, we can track students
who change CEGEPs, and be more accurate in our determinations of which
students drop out

\chapter{Literature}\label{literature}

\section{Modeling success and attrition in
CEGEP}\label{modeling-success-and-attrition-in-cegep}

The most important relevant work for this project is
\citep{jorgensen_predicting_2009}.

\section{Predictive Modelling in Learning Analytics and Educational Data
Mining}\label{predictive-modelling-in-learning-analytics-and-educational-data-mining}

\citep{hla2017}

\chapter{Descriptive Statistics}\label{descriptive-statistics}

Here in we will describe - the data set - the methods by which we label
students at risk - the distributions of at-risk students by -
demographic indicators - registration record indicators

\section{Demographics across the colleges and major
programs}\label{demographics-across-the-colleges-and-major-programs}

Do students who drop out do so because of poor grades? What fraction of
students are counted year after year as drop-outs and labeled as
problems to be solved by the system while being exemplary students in
terms of academic performance. Armed with this dataset, we can get the
answer to that question. Let us begin by looking at the average grades
of students who eventually dropped out compared to grades of students
who haven't. The following set of graphs will look at that comparison
for 3 different semesters: the semester in which they dropped out (or
graduated), the semester before that and the one before that. Let us see
what the data says.
\includegraphics{studentsuccess_final_report_files/figure-latex/Average-comp-1.pdf}

\begin{verbatim}
## 
##  Welch Two Sample t-test
## 
## data:  Average_all_courses by status
## t = 78.251, df = 7349.6, p-value < 2.2e-16
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  20.36923 21.41600
## sample estimates:
## mean in group grad  mean in group out 
##           79.97370           59.08109
\end{verbatim}

From the average total grade between the drop outs and the graduates, we
can clearly see that the distributions are significantly different, but
what is surprising is that 22\% of students have an average grade above
75\% and that more than 52\% of the students who dropped out had an
average grade above 60\%. In other words, most students who drop out
have passing averages. One hypothesis for this effect is that students
who end up dropping out start with good semesters and have their
performance decline closer to the final semester. Let us verify this
hypothesis.

Let us now look at the performance of drop outs vs graduates on a
semester by semester basis. Let us start by looking at the average
grades of students in their last semester during which they are either
graduating or dropping-out.

\includegraphics{studentsuccess_final_report_files/figure-latex/Last-semester-comp-1.pdf}

\begin{verbatim}
## 
##  Welch Two Sample t-test
## 
## data:  avg_grade by status
## t = 84.649, df = 7619.5, p-value < 2.2e-16
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  27.00250 28.28279
## sample estimates:
## mean in group grad  mean in group out 
##           79.17656           51.53391
\end{verbatim}

In this data, we can clearly observe a stark difference between the
graduates and the drop outs. First of all, note that 23\% of students
still have a term average over 75\% in the semester in which they drop
out. To push it further 15\% of students who drop out have an average
grade over 80\%. The data clearly suggests that some of the drop outs
aren't dropping out because of academic performance. Furthermore, the
long tail of the data on the low end of performance suggests that some
of the students stopped coming to class prior to the end of the semester
resulting in very low grades that serve to drive their cegep average
grades from the graph above even lower. 34\% of students have a grade
below 40 suggesting that they have indeed stopped coming to school some
time during the semester. What if these students hadn't stopped coming,
would their performance be similar to that of graduates?

Let us now turn our attention to the semester before the one where they
graduate or drop out.

\includegraphics{studentsuccess_final_report_files/figure-latex/N-1-semester-comp-1.pdf}

\begin{verbatim}
## 
##  Welch Two Sample t-test
## 
## data:  avg_grade by status
## t = 57.702, df = 6604.9, p-value < 2.2e-16
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  15.65690 16.75814
## sample estimates:
## mean in group grad  mean in group out 
##           80.56981           64.36230
\end{verbatim}

The data clearly shows that even if there are significant differences
between the groups, the drop out student population is getting closer to
the graduate population. A section of 33\% is observed to have an
average grade above 75\%.

Finally, let us look at 2 semesters before they graduate or drop-out. We
are again expecting the same trend.

\includegraphics{studentsuccess_final_report_files/figure-latex/N-2-semester-comp-1.pdf}

\begin{verbatim}
## 
##  Welch Two Sample t-test
## 
## data:  avg_grade by status
## t = 42.166, df = 4390.4, p-value < 2.2e-16
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  10.95430 12.02262
## sample estimates:
## mean in group grad  mean in group out 
##           80.42574           68.93729
\end{verbatim}

In conclusion, the data strongly suggests that there are approximately
20\% of students who consistently have averages above 75\%, but still
drop out. Therefore, that section of the drop out population is a
section that will always go undetected if only traditional academic
failure metrics are used to assess which students are likely to drop
out. Students who move out to the US or the rest of Canada after their
second semester and those who drop out by lack of interest are two
potential student types that will always drop out no matter what
remedial solutions are offered for them.

\section{Fraction of students who change
colleges}\label{fraction-of-students-who-change-colleges}

\chapter{Methods Centered on Determining Predictive
Factors}\label{methods-centered-on-determining-predictive-factors}

This chapter will be focused on methods which have a sound probabilistic
framework, and allow for inference into the statistical importance of
predictive factors.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Logistic Regression
\item
  Mixed Effects Models
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Methods centered on predicting at-risk
students}\label{methods-centered-on-predicting-at-risk-students}

Over the last twenty years, there has an increasing amount of work in
the applied social sciences that explore the use of what
\citep{breiman2001twocultures} refers to as ``algorithmic modelling''``,
as opposed to''data modelling``. He describes these as two cultures, the
former being made up of mostly computer scientists, and the latter being
made up statisticians (the methods therein are the ones explored in the
previous chapter of this report). The key metric in such classical
methods are \textbf{goodness of fit}, and such''explanatory``''
modelling aims to find associative and causal relationships between
predictors. Meanwhile, ``algorithmic''``, or''predictive``'' methods
emphasize determining any function that maps input variables to output
responses, with less regard for a probabilitic framework that allows for
causation, focusing solely on emprirical
precision\citep{shmueli2010explain}. In the recently published
\textbf{Handbok of Learning Analytics}\citep{hla2017}, published by the
Society of Learning Analytics Research, \citep{bergner_measurement_2017}
asserts that the researchers looking into educational data stand to gain
from understanding the nuances of both methodologies, as previous work
has shown the strengths and weakeness of either in this domain.

The previous chapter explored how classical statistical models can be
built and used to determine what are the factors that influence dropout.
This is useful for policy makers and admninstrators who want to dedicate
resources in the most strategic places. However this chapter will
explore models whose inner workings are less interpretable, but whose
primary objective is prediction/identification of at-risk students. This
is useful in the context where college administration has some blanket
intervention that it would like to apply, and we just want to ensure
that the students most in need are reached. Despite the less clear
interpratability of factors in these \emph{predictive} models (as
compared to the \emph{explanatory} models in the previous chapter), we
will stil explore methods to ``open up the black box'', and determine
which features are most important in achieving both accrate and
sensitive prediction.

\section{Decision Trees and Random
Forests}\label{decision-trees-and-random-forests}

\section{Neural Networks}\label{neural-networks}

\chapter{Comparisons}\label{comparisons}

This chapter will compare the effectiveness of the methods developped in
the previous two chapters, and compare them to more basic approaches to
identifying students at-risk.

For example, we know that some CEGEPs have implemented a policy whereby
they identify students as being at risk based on their mid-term
assessments: if the student receives a certain number of ``at-risk'' or
``failing'' results, they are automatically sent an email referring them
to academic support services.

Based on this, we can ask the following research questions : - how
effective is this approach at identifying students who drop-out? - how
does this approach compare to our models from the previous chapters?

We begin with a basic logistic regression with demographic variables,
and as well as the number of each type of results of mid-term
assessment, for students in their last term at the college. With these
predictors, we try to predict if students are about to graduate, or
simply not register again.

\chapter{Continuing Education at
Dawson}\label{continuing-education-at-dawson}

The department of Continuing at Education offers evening courses across
many disciplines throughout the year. The purpose of this report is to
give a broad overview of the demographics and sector-level metrics for
students taking courses within Cont Ed.

\section{Services}\label{services}

Herein, we look at the services offered by the Division of Continuing
Education.

\subsection{Continuing Education's Growth over
Time}\label{continuing-educations-growth-over-time}

How have each of the departments increased their ContEd offerings over
time?

\includegraphics{studentsuccess_final_report_files/figure-latex/dept-level-sizes-over-time-1.pdf}

\subsection{Department Level Seat
Distributions}\label{department-level-seat-distributions}

Which parts of Continuing Education are the most important in 2016?

\includegraphics{studentsuccess_final_report_files/figure-latex/dept-level-sizes-2016-1.pdf}

\subsection{Course Level
distributions}\label{course-level-distributions}

If we look at the three most important departments (Math,Humanities and
English) in 2016, how are the seats distrinuted across courses?

\includegraphics{studentsuccess_final_report_files/figure-latex/big-dept-seat-dist-by-course-1.pdf}

\subsection{Specialized spaces}\label{specialized-spaces}

If we look at the departments that require specialized spaces
(i.e.~labs), in 2016, how are the seats distributed by course? - Has
this evolved over time? - What are the seasonal variations?

\subsubsection{Winter}\label{winter}

\includegraphics{studentsuccess_final_report_files/figure-latex/lab-dept-seat-dist-by-course-winter-1.pdf}

\subsubsection{Fall}\label{fall}

\includegraphics{studentsuccess_final_report_files/figure-latex/lab-dept-seat-dist-by-course-fall-1.pdf}

\subsubsection{Summer}\label{summer}

\includegraphics{studentsuccess_final_report_files/figure-latex/lab-dept-seat-dist-by-course-summer-1.pdf}

\section{Students}\label{students}

\subsection{Demographics}\label{demographics}

Who are the students using continuing education services?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  are there gender differences?
\item
  are there age differences?
\item
  do these demographics change over time?
\item
  are there seasonal variations?
\item
  are there differences in different departments?
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Sexe}\label{sexe}

\includegraphics{studentsuccess_final_report_files/figure-latex/Sexe-demographics-over-time-1.pdf}

What is impact of condensed summer term?

\includegraphics{studentsuccess_final_report_files/figure-latex/Sexe-demographics-over-time-summer-1.pdf}

Finally, as there seems to be relatively little change in these patterns
over time, we can collapse all over the past seven years,

\includegraphics{studentsuccess_final_report_files/figure-latex/Sexe-demographics-1.pdf}

and then add on the average grade achieved by students with the same
gender, in the same courses from the same disciplines, but from the
``regular'' day division.

\includegraphics{studentsuccess_final_report_files/figure-latex/Sexe-demographics-day-mean-1.pdf}

\subsubsection{Birth Place}\label{birth-place}

Now, instead of looking at effect of gender, we focus instead on Birth
Place. To Quebec residents stand out in any consistent way, as compared
to those born elsewhere?

\includegraphics{studentsuccess_final_report_files/figure-latex/birth-place-demographics-over-time-1.pdf}

Again, what is impact of condensed summer term?

\includegraphics{studentsuccess_final_report_files/figure-latex/birth-place-demographics-over-time-summer-1.pdf}

Finally, as there seems to be relatively little change in these patterns
over time, we can collapse all over the past seven years,

\includegraphics{studentsuccess_final_report_files/figure-latex/birth-place-demographics-1.pdf}

and then add on the average grade achieved by students with the same
\textbf{birth place} (namely quebec residents vs \emph{other}), in the
same courses from the same disciplines, but from the ``regular'' day
division.

\includegraphics{studentsuccess_final_report_files/figure-latex/birth-place-demographics-day-mean-1.pdf}

\subsubsection{Mother Tongue}\label{mother-tongue}

Finally we look at the possible impact of Mother Tongue. How do
anglophones, francophones, and allophones compare in Continuing
Education?

\includegraphics{studentsuccess_final_report_files/figure-latex/langue-demographics-over-time-1.pdf}

Again, what is impact of condensed summer term?

\includegraphics{studentsuccess_final_report_files/figure-latex/langue-demographics-over-time-summer-1.pdf}

Finally, as there seems to be relatively little change in these patterns
over time, we can collapse all over the past seven years,

and then add on the average grade achieved by students with the same
\textbf{mother tongue}, in the same courses from the same disciplines,
but from the ``regular'' day division.

\subsection{Success Rates}\label{success-rates}

There are many students who take courses through both Continuing
Education, and the regular day division over the course of their time at
Dawson. One way of measuring the difference in the student experience
here would be to look at those students alone, and compare the average
of their grades in each division, while controlling for discipline. (the
diagonal in each facet is simply meant to provide a reference for a
hypothetical 1-to-1 correlation.) In order to control for student
strength, we bin by overall average of high school grades.

\chapter{Final Words}\label{final-words}

We have finished a nice book.
